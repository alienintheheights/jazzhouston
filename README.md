===========

rails app for jazzhouston web site, http://jazzhouston.com. 

Currently using Rails 3.2.0 and Ruby 1.8.7 (hosting service doesn't have Ruby 1.9 yet and I don't want to set it up locally on their servers).

In May 2013, I refactored the site to use Twitter Bootstrap. There's still some ExtJS code in use that will get thrown out soon.

August 2013: refactored the mobile site to use jQueryMobile.

August 2013: moved to the CarrierWave gem. for users, articles, and venues.

Febrary 2014: upgraded to rails 3.2.0, the apparent limit for the hosting service.

UPDATE::

March 2014: migrating all registration code to Devise 2.0; refactoring fat controllers to use service objects. Work underway.
