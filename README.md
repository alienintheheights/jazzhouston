===========

rails app for jazzhouston web site, http://jazzhouston.com. 

Currently using Rails 3.0.20 and Ruby 1.8.7 (hosting service doesn't have Ruby 1.9 yet and I don't want to set it up locally on their servers).

In May 2013, I refactored the site to use Twitter Bootstrap. There's still some ExtJS code in use that will get thrown out soon.

In August 2013, I refactored the mobile site to use jQueryMobile.

In August 2013, I moved to the CarrierWave gem. for users, articles, and venues.
